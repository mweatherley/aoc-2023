# Day 8 (Part 1)
([AoC link](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8))
This is another problem where the first part is essentially just asking you to code a correct simulation. I don't think there is really anything interesting to discuss, but this is the first example of a graph traversal, and we see here that I landed on encoding the graph as a map keyed by the node-labels and storing the adjacent node-labels as values. There will be many more like this.

(Note that this has two solutions for Part 2.)
