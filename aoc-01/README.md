# Day 1

This problem was mostly for getting your feet wet, I think. For the first part, I just iterated over the characters and did the obvious thing. 

The only real complication arises in Part 2, where you have to account for the possibility of overlap between number words â€” e.g. `fiveight` or `twone`, which should be respectively interpreted as 8 and 1. To do this, I kept a buffer holding the last five characters (all of the number words from one to nine have at most five characters) and matched its postfixes against the number words. I see now that I used a `VecDeque` for this, but that seems a little overkill, since a fixed-size structure would probably result in faster code (being on the stack and all). Maybe a `no_std` tool like a heapless queue implementation would have been a good choice.
